# Traffic-Light-System
Project of Traffic Light System for transportation using Arduino IDE and Arduino Uno

**How It Work**

This system utilises three LEDs, which are red, green, and yellow. The usage of the LED is to signal the status of the traffic lights. When vehicles are detected at the traffic light, the red led flashes three times to signal all vehicles to prepare for movement before turning green. The green LED then transitions to yellow, that flashes five times along with a buzzer to alert all vehicles prepare to stop. By this function, the system minimizes accidents by giving drivers a warning to go or stop. If no vehicles are detected, the traffic light remains red, which reduce unnecessary light changes and energy consumption. This system designed to ensure the efficiency in traffic flow, which contributes a more sustainable transportation infrastructure.
